# Info

The classic Voxel effect made on a rapsberry pi 3B. Develop on C and assembler. Use of level of detail to focus on the nearest pixel and have fewer details on the farthest one and tilling.  sing also fixed float point. After some iteration and optimization, I make the inner loop on assembler.
